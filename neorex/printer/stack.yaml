# A 'specific' Stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# snapshot: lts-22.28
# snapshot: nightly-2024-07-05
# snapshot: ghc-9.6.6
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# snapshot: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# snapshot: https://example.com/snapshots/2024-01-01.yaml
snapshot: lts-22.34
packages: ["."]
