cords

; this is a test of the megapin structure. what we want to do is make a
; structure where there's a toplevel megapin which indexes multiple levels of
; structure, so we want each row to be something like `#0[#0[##0[%one]]]` where
; there are two pins outside, and a megapin that only contains one pin. we then
; have several of these side by side to make sure the toplevel megapin collects
; the upper structural pins, and stops at the megapin boundary that contains
; the numbered cords.

; put some garbage onto the pin heap
