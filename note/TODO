-  <1> should increment the given arity instead of crashing if given a
   zero arity.

-  <2> should go away, and be implemented by constructing a law
   and then fetching it's arity.


Case
====

-   Right now `Case` casts it's input to a nat before switching, which
    means that non-nat inputs are treated as 0.  Would it make more sense
    to instead treat non-nat keys as OOB?

    -   This would make the jetted implementation slightly faster.

    -   The behavior seems more intuitive.  In particular, it matches
        behavior of `If`.

    -   This would also affect the behavior of `Ix` in the same ways.

Seed
====

-   Explore the idea of making seed use LETREC (all frags are in scope
    in all frags).  This will make seeds bigger, but.

    1.  May simplify encoding and decoding (since the scope and refsz
        aren't constantly changing)

    2.  May improve compression potential, since repeated references to
        a certain node will have a consistent bit-pattern instead of being
        different in different contexts.

    3.  Makes it possible to encode infinite data structures in Seed.
        (You mostly don't want to do this, but it would be cool if this
        was possible).
